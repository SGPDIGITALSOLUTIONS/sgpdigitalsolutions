                      <p>Before we start any work, we'll agree on what we're doing, how much it costs, and when it'll be done. 
                      This might be a formal contract or just a detailed email - whatever works for the size of your project.</p>

                      <h3 className="font-semibold text-white mb-2">üí∞ Payment Terms</h3>
                      <p>We like to be paid. Shocking, we know. For bigger projects, we'll usually ask for 50% upfront and 50% on completion. 
                      For smaller jobs, we might just invoice you when we're done. Payment is due within 30 days, or we'll send increasingly passive-aggressive reminders.</p>

                      <p>We'll give you realistic timelines and stick to them. If something's going to be late, we'll let you know ASAP. 
                      We're not miracle workers - good work takes time, and rushing usually makes things worse.</p>

                    Once you've paid in full, the website/application we build for you is yours. You own it, you can do what you want with it. 
                    We might keep some of the underlying code we've written for our own use in future projects, but your specific content and design is all yours.

                    Either of us can cancel a project with reasonable notice. If you cancel:

                    We might update these terms occasionally. If we do, we'll update the date below and let you know if anything major changes.

                    it'll be in the UK courts. We'd much rather sort things out over a cup of tea, though.
